<h1>Hi, you don't run any arbitrary scripts either!</h1>

Unfortunately, this website depends on JavaScript and CSS to work. It doesnâ€™t use any Google services but it does use OpenStreetMap, W3W and Leaflet. It requests your location but that is for the functionality of the map API.<br \>

<h2 style="color:red">Please use a browser that supports JavaScript for full functionality of this site!</h2>
Stay safe and smart!<br />
